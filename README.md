After you search for a book, you will see the search results in the "Results" container. Here you can "VIEW", which will direct you to the Google Play store where you can get more information on the book and purchase the book. Another option you have in the "Results" container is to "SAVE" which will save the book for you to look back on later under the "Saved" page.

On the Saved page, in the "Saved Books" container, you can see a list of books you saved for later. You can "VIEW", which like before will direct you to the Google Play store. You can also "DELETE" the book from your saved books list.
